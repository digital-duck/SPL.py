# Recipe 77 — Neurosymbolic: One Workflow, the Whole Verifier Ladder

**Pattern:** ONE declarative workflow (`symbolic_math.spl`) where the
probabilistic regime (`GENERATE` — plan, formalize, judge, narrate) and the
deterministic regime (SymPy / SageMath / Lean 4 + mathlib — compute, typecheck,
kernel-check) compose seamlessly, and the deterministic backend is selected by
a single `--param backend=` flip.

This is the capstone of the verifier-ladder track
([`docs/DEV/sage_lean_integration_plan.md`](../../docs/DEV/sage_lean_integration_plan.md)):
recipe 67 proved the SymPy rung, recipe 75 the Sage rung, recipe 76 the Lean
rung — recipe 77 puts all three behind the *same* problem text, the *same*
models, and the *same* experiment harness.

## What this demonstrates

```
Probabilistic  (LLM)      — decompose the problem into a chain   (sympy/sage)
Deterministic  (SymPy)    — exact instances: diff, integrate, solve, ...
Deterministic  (Sage)     — instances SymPy can't reach: Galois groups (PARI),
                            rational points on conics over ℚ, elliptic-curve
                            rank, exact algebraic eigenvalues
Probabilistic  (LLM)      — explain the verified chain
       — or, for claims —
Probabilistic  (LLM)      — formalize the claim as a mathlib proposition
Deterministic  (Lean)     — statement_ok typecheck, capped repair loop
Probabilistic  (LLM)      — faithfulness judge (§B.4) — UNFAITHFUL gates the proof
Deterministic  (Lean)     — find_citation: exact? locally, Loogle fallback,
                            EVERY candidate kernel-checked (B-5)
Deterministic  (Lean)     — LLM tactic proof, kernel-checked repair loop (B-3)
```

The epistemic difference between the rungs is the point
(plan §1): SymPy/Sage verify **instances** (*this* Galois group, *this*
eigenvalue), Lean verifies **statements** (`∀ a : ℝ, 0 ≤ a ^ 2` — the theorem
itself). The lean arm returns its badge as the run status —
`machine_proved` / `statement_checked` / `unfaithful` / `unverified` — so the
harness scores proof-grade outcomes honestly.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `sympolic_tools.spl` | Shared TOOL_API + FUNCTION library — both chain kernels (`solve_step_with_sympy`, `solve_step_with_sage`, same `<bare>\|<readable>` protocol and `solver_error` sentinel), Lean helpers (`strip_fences`, `make_theorem`, `lean_report`), and all LLM prompt templates (decompose/explain/solve-directly + the mathlib formalize/judge/tactics set) |
| `symbolic_math.spl` | The workflow: `neurosymbolic_solver` routes on `@backend` (sympy \| sage \| lean) and `@enable_solver` (verified arm vs LLM-only baseline); `solve_chain_step` dispatches one chain step to the chosen engine |
| `run_experiment.py` | CLI harness (cloned from recipe 67): problems × models × solver × runs, with a per-problem default backend and a `--backend` override axis; results in SQLite |
| `run_experiment.sh` | Thin driver: activates `spl123`, forwards to `run_experiment.py` (env-var presets `MODELS` / `PROBLEMS` / `SOLVER_MODES` / `BACKEND` / `N_RUNS` still work, recipe-67 style) |

## The problem battery

`p001`–`p020` are recipe 67's battery, kept verbatim (Tier 0–5, diff → ODEs)
— **with the compute engine swapped from SymPy to SageMath** as the
per-problem default. Sage subsumes the SymPy operations (every shared op is
exact — eigenvalues come back as `5/2 ± √33/2`, not floats), so the swap is
one dispatch branch, not a rewrite; `--backend sympy` re-runs the identical
battery on the old rung for comparison.

New problems extend the ladder:

| IDs | Tier | Backend | What they add |
|---|---|---|---|
| `p021`–`p024` | T6 | sage | Operations SymPy cannot do: Galois group of `x⁵−x−1` (PARI), rational point on `x²+y²=3z²`, Mordell–Weil rank of an elliptic curve, factorization over ℚ |
| `p025`–`p029` | P1–P2 | lean | Prose **claims** proved against mathlib: commutativity of ℕ-addition, `0 ≤ a²` over ℝ, the triangle inequality, infinitude of primes, evenness closure |

## Provisioning

```bash
# SymPy — already in the spl123 env
pip install 'spl-llm[sage]'                            # Sage (passagemath wheels, same interpreter)
bash cookbook/tools/lean/setup_lean.sh --with-mathlib  # Lean + mathlib (~5 GB olean cache, one-time)
```

## Run

Single problems, three rungs, one flag apart:

```bash
# Sage rung (default backend): Galois group — SymPy cannot do this
spl3 run cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/symbolic_math.spl --kernel --llm claude_cli \
    --param problem="find the Galois group of x**5 - x - 1 over the rationals"

# SymPy rung: same chain machinery, classic battery
spl3 run cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/symbolic_math.spl --kernel --llm claude_cli \
    --param backend=sympy --param problem="differentiate 3*x**3-x, then factor if needed, finally solve for x"

# Lean rung: a CLAIM, kernel-checked against mathlib (citation-first)
spl3 run cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/symbolic_math.spl --kernel --llm claude_cli \
    --param backend=lean --param problem="the square of any real number is nonnegative"

# Baseline arm: same problem, NO verifier — the A/B contrast
spl3 run cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/symbolic_math.spl --kernel --llm claude_cli \
    --param backend=lean --param enable_solver=false \
    --param problem="the square of any real number is nonnegative"
```

The experiment harness (axes: problems × models × solver on/off × repetitions,
plus the backend override):

```bash
python cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/run_experiment.py --list          # see all IDs
python cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/run_experiment.py -m m001 -p p021  # smoke: Galois
python cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/run_experiment.py -m m001 -p p025  # smoke: Lean citation
python cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/run_experiment.py -m m001 -p "p001,p003" --backend sympy
python cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/run_experiment.py -m "m001,m010"   # full battery, 2 models

# or via the driver (recipe-67 style env presets)
MODELS=m001 PROBLEMS=p025 bash cookbook/77_neurosymbolic/run_experiment.sh
```

## Pass criteria

| Arm | Pass statuses |
|---|---|
| solver, backend sympy/sage | `complete` (the chain verified end-to-end) |
| solver, backend lean | `machine_proved` only — `statement_checked` means the formalization typechecks but the claim is unproven; `unfaithful` means the judge gated it (§B.4) |
| LLM-only baseline | `complete` / `unverified_success` — fluent output with *no* verification, by construction |

## Key learning points

1. **The backend is a parameter, not an architecture.** Swapping
   SymPy → Sage → Lean changes *what stands behind* `CALL`/the kernel —
   the workflow shape, the prompts, and the harness stay fixed. That is the
   "seamless dual-processing" claim made concrete.
2. **Sage is the umbrella, not a sidecar** (plan §A.1): the passagemath wheels
   run in the same interpreter, so `solve_step_with_sage` is a drop-in
   TOOL_API — and `galois` / `conic` / `rank` reach PARI with no new SPL
   constructs.
3. **Proof failure is data, not an error** (§B.2): the lean arm never blocks —
   it returns its badge as the status, and the harness counts
   `statement_checked` and `unfaithful` outcomes separately from
   `machine_proved`.
4. **The checked artifact never round-trips through the LLM** (recipe 67's
   lesson, at every rung): `PREV` resolution, `make_theorem` splicing, and
   kernel-checked citations are all deterministic.
