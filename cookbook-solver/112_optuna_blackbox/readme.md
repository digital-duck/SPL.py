# Recipe 112 — Optuna Black-Box Strategy Optimization

**The key story:** A SaaS team needs to tune (monthly_price, annual_discount_pct, trial_days) to maximize customer LTV. The LTV model is non-convex with no gradient. Optuna TPE (50 trials) finds price≈\$45.7, discount≈3.6%, trial≈30 days → LTV=\$246 — a **+48%** improvement over the naive baseline (\$166). The LLM's recommendation (\$79, 20% discount, 14-day trial) goes in the opposite direction on all three dimensions, reasoning from real-world SaaS heuristics that conflict with the actual objective function's structure.

## What it demonstrates

| Axis | solver=ON | solver=OFF |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | Optuna TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) | LLM heuristic reasoning |
| Guarantee | Global optimum approximation over 50 trials | Local intuition, misses parameter interactions |
| Objective | Non-convex black-box (churn + conversion model) | "Lower price = more customers = better LTV" |
| Verification | `ASSERT optimization_improved` (C1) | — |
| Solver class | C1 (improvement verified vs baseline) + C2 (LTV recomputed) | — |

## Background

**Optuna Black-Box Strategy Optimization** addresses the regime where the objective function has no closed form and no gradient — where analytical solvers (PuLP, cvxpy) and gradient descent cannot apply.

**The problem:** A SaaS team tunes three levers — monthly price ($30–$120), annual discount (0–40%), trial length (3–30 days) — to maximize customer lifetime value (LTV). The LTV model is non-convex because of three interacting non-linearities:
- Conversion saturates with trial length (diminishing returns past ~10 days)
- Churn spikes discontinuously when price > $50 or discount > 25%
- The price × discount interaction creates a valley around the "intuitive" naive point

**What Optuna does:** TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) builds a probabilistic model of where good values occur based on previous trials, then samples new points in promising regions. No gradient required — it treats the objective as a pure black box. After 50 trials it finds price ≈ $43, 28% discount, 7-day trial → LTV ≈ $218, versus the LLM's intuitive guess of $50 / 20% / 14-day → LTV ≈ $172 (21% worse).

**The core insight:** The LLM's reasoning is "lower price = more customers = better LTV" — a monotonic heuristic that ignores the churn/discount interaction. The short trial (7 days vs 14) is counter-intuitive but correct because conversion saturates quickly and longer trials delay first payment without meaningfully improving retention.

**Position in the solver taxonomy:** Optuna sits between scipy.optimize (needs a gradient, non-convex) and Bayesian GP (r113, fewer trials but heavier prior modeling). It's the right tool when the objective is a simulation, A/B test result, or any function you can evaluate but not differentiate.

## Why this objective is hard

The LTV function has three interacting non-linearities:
1. **Conversion**: `1 - exp(-trial_days/10)` — saturates at ~30 days; short trials not catastrophic
2. **Churn penalty**: jumps at `price > 50` and `discount > 25` — high-discount churners are cheap customers
3. **Revenue per customer**: discount × price interaction creates a valley at naive (50, 20%) parameters

No gradient. No closed form. Optuna samples where previous trials showed improvement.

## Default problem parameters

| Parameter | Range | Naive baseline | Optuna Best | LLM solver=OFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| monthly_price | \$30–\$120 | \$50 | **\$45.7** | \$79 |
| annual_discount_pct | 0%–40% | 20% | **3.6%** | 20% |
| trial_days | 3–30 | 14 days | **30 days** | 14 days |
| **LTV** | — | **\$166** | **\$246 (+48%)** | ~\$2,570* |

\* LLM computed LTV using its own ARPU/churn formula (revenue ÷ monthly_churn_rate), not the recipe's black-box objective — the numbers are not comparable.

### Three-way parameter disagreement

Every parameter recommendation is opposite between Optuna and the LLM:

| Parameter | LLM solver=OFF | Optuna solver=ON | Why they diverge |
|---|---|---|---|
| Price | \$79 ("below \$80 psychological barrier") | \$45.7 | LLM avoids "low-price = low-value signal"; objective's churn spikes above \$50 |
| Discount | 20% ("2.4× LTV multiplier via annual plans") | 3.6% | LLM models discount as churn reducer; objective penalizes discount > 25% |
| Trial days | 14 ("urgency deadline, tire-kicker filter") | 30 days | LLM fears tire-kickers; objective's conversion saturates upward with trial length |

### The LLM's reasoning is coherent — but for a different objective

Solver=OFF produced well-argued SaaS pricing advice: lower price attracts bargain hunters, annual discounts reduce churn 3×, 30-day trials attract tire-kickers. These are real-world heuristics backed by industry data. The LLM even computed its own LTV formula: LTV = ARPU ÷ monthly\_churn\_rate, arriving at ~\$2,570 — a plausible number for a \$79/mo product.

The problem: its reasoning is anchored to general SaaS playbook intuition, not the specific black-box function in this recipe. The recipe's LTV model has three structural features the LLM could not know:
- Churn spikes discontinuously at price > \$50 (making \$79 severely penalized)
- Discount > 25% triggers a churn spike (making 20% near the penalty boundary)
- Conversion `1 - exp(-trial_days/10)` saturates positively (making 30 days strictly better than 14)

This is the fundamental case for black-box optimization: when the objective has hidden non-linearities and discontinuities that no heuristic framework can anticipate, you have to evaluate it empirically.

### Key takeaway

solver=ON is 2× faster and finds a 48% improvement the LLM not only missed but argued against. The LLM's counter-argument is internally consistent and would be good advice in the real world — but it is reasoning about a different LTV model than the one being optimized. Optuna makes no assumptions: it evaluates the actual function 50 times and converges on the true optimum.
